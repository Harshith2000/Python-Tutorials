#Imagine an parking lot with 20 parking spaces, where each parking space has an ID which is a natural number, starting with 1, 2, 3, â€¦.upto 20. Parking space '1' is the one closest to the entrance.
#The parking space can be in three sizes: small(10 parking spaces), medium(7 parking spaces) and large slots(3 parking spaces).
#Three types of vehicles are allowed to be parked in a parking space: motorcycle(small), car(medium) and bus(large)
#A motorcycle can be parked in any small, medium or large parking spaces.
#A car can be parked in either a medium slot or a large parking spaces.
#A bus can be parked only in a large parking space.
#When a user enters the parking lot, vehicle type and vehicle ID are noted and fed as input to our system
#Our system should assign the vehicle to the nearest parking space available(if any parking space is available)
#User should be given a printed ticket with the assigned parking spot ID and his vehicle ID
